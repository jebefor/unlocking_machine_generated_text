# Unlocking Machine Generated Text

Repo status: ongoing.

## About

*How can we differenciate machine generated text from human text?* :thinking:

Latest generative models are making it more difficult to detect if a text is machine generated. However, there's still "no more" than [probability](http://gltr.io/) to it. 

This repo will serve as an ongoing personal research on linguistic features that could be determinant (or not) for machine generated text detection. :computer:

## Features so far

- Sentiment analysis
- Subjectivity
- Readability
- Punctuation
- POS (verb/noun use)
